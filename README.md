# effective-mobile-rest-api
This repository contains the source code for a REST API service that enriches Full Names (FIO) obtained from an external API with additional information such as age, gender, and nationality. The enriched data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, and the service offers various RESTful endpoints for data retrieval, modification, and addition.
